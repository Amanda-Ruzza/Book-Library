# Book-Library
Book Library API
Simple API using Flask

Created a 3 book database using a Dictionary in Python, then I used the following methods:
1) GET METHOD to collect the information from my computer into the web browser
2) POST METHOD to execute 2 things:
    a. to add a 4th book to the database
    b. to update the information on book #3 inside the database (I could have used the PUT METHOD as well, however, Pascal said that for this, the POST METHOD is easier)
3) DELETE METHOD to delete a specified book from the dictionary
